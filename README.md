# Big Calendar

Big Calendar is 36inches square and displays entire year. The months are
aranged in a circle on the outside edge.

In the center of the calander radian lines indecate the length of each
day.  The Lines are drawn in half inch scale.  The Sunrise and Sunset 
for each day can be read by placing the Zero of an Archetects ruler on
the inner most circle. An 18" Architect scale is needed to read sunset 
times which are past 22:00 hours during the longest days of summer.
Sunrise will apear where it should at around 4" to 6" inches which can
be directly converted to hours minutes.

Full and new moon are displayed for the whole years. The Chinese version
was created because the months align with the full moon.
